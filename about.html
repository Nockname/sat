                        <p>Nick Hagedorn is a senior at Princeton High School. He became interested in math at a young age through the National Museum of Mathematics. He's also a big fan of logic puzzles and other games and has discovered that he can beat both Tylers at four-player chess. Nick first met Tyler Kim during the Ross Mathematics Program in 2021 as they struggled to prove quadratic reciprocity together. He returned to the program as a Junior Counselor in 2022. Outside of math, he competes in Public Forum debate. Nick also enjoys orchestral music composition and programming.</p>

                        <p>Tyler Kim, the superior Tyler, is a freshman at Harvard University. He first discovered his passion for problem solving at a young age, when he was introduced to the Game of 24 (one of our competition rounds!). The idea of starting a collaborative and fun math day came to him when he visited his brother's class and realized how school sometimes relegates math into formulas and memorization, when it is much more.  His roots in math and logic have also led him to pick up competitive chess, and he enjoys beating Tyler Yang often! In his free time, Tyler can be found playing basketball, reading, going on road trips with his family, and thinking about fantasy football outcomes.  </p>

Puzzle culture runs in his family, and he’s spent his childhood solving logic puzzles, Harvard CS50x puzzles, and tackling other challenges. This, more recently, includes Wordle, NYT Spelling Bee, Quordle, Luminosity, and Octordle... He first got interested in competition in 9th grade, when his teacher recommended he start a competitive Math Club at Yorba Linda High School. When he’s not absolutely crushing Tyler Kim in chess, he spends his free time reading, strumming guitar, playing tennis, and running.</p>
