                        <p>This Game of 24 is what first got Tyler Kim interested in math! It will take place from 9:50 to 10:10. Each team will receive a series of problems, each with four numbers, and must come up with a way to combine the numbers to equal 24. For example: if given the numbers 2, 1, 3, and 4, a solution is 2*3*1*4=24. Can you find a solution for the one above?</p>
